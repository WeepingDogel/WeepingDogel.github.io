      <description>PAST If only I had been stronger,
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been damaged by the WIND.
If only I had been smarter,
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been cheated by the CROWD.
If only I had been more brave,
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been thought to be a SLAVE.
PRESENT If only I were more fortunate,
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t drop into a CAGE.
If only I were more cautious,
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to be sure if it&amp;rsquo;s DANGEROUS.</description>
