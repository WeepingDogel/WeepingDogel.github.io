However, for modern Intel graphics hardware (roughly 2007 and newer), it is often recommended to remove this package for several reasons: Better support with modesetting driver: The modesetting driver, which is part of the X server and does not need to be installed separately, has better support for modern graphics features and hardware. It is maintained by the X.Org project and tends to keep up with new developments in graphics technology github.com. Issues with xf86-video-intel driver: The xf86-video-intel driver has been known to cause issues on some systems, including graphical glitches and poorer performance compared to the modesetting driver. In some cases, it can even lead to system instability bbs.archlinux.org. Lack of active development: The xf86-video-intel driver has not seen active development for several years, which means it may lack support for features found in newer hardware and software. On the other hand, the modesetting driver is actively developed as part of the X server reddit.com. To remove the xf86-video-intel package, you can use the package manager of your specific Linux distribution. Here’s an example using pacman, the package manager for Arch Linux: sudo pacman -R xf86-video-intel After removing the package, restart your system to ensure the changes take effect. Remember to check the documentation of your specific distribution for the correct way to remove packages and handle drivers.

Under the current tenancy, create two virtual machines using the CentOS7.9 image and 4vCPU/12G/100G_50G type. The second network card should be created and connected to both the controller and compute nodes (the second network card’s subnet is 10.10.X.0/24, where X represents the workstation number, and no routing is needed). Verify the security group policies to ensure normal network communication and ssh connection, and configure the servers as follows: Set the hostname of the control node to ‘controller’ and that of the compute node to ‘compute’; Modify the hosts file to map IP addresses to hostnames. After completing the configuration, submit the username, password, and IP address of the control node in the answer box. The first quiz is eazy, just some steps can be done. At the controller Node: [root@controller ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname controller At the compute Node: [root@compute ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname compute Edit the file /etc/hosts: [root@controller ~]# vim /etc/hosts Write these: 127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4 ::1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6 192.168.56.100 Resource 192.168.56.2 controller 192.168.56.3 compute Save it by :wq. Then send it to compute Node by scp: [root@controller ~]# scp /etc/hosts root@compute:/etc/hosts Finally, all the operation is complete. [Question 2] Yum Repository Configuration [0.5 points] Using the provided HTTP service address, there are CentOS 7.9 and IaaS network YUM repositories available under the HTTP service. Use this HTTP source as the network source for installing the IaaS platform. Set up the yum source file http.repo for both the controller node and compute node. After completion, submit the username, password, and IP address of the control node to the answer box. Well, it’s still a easy question. First, delete the old repo files in two nodes: [root@controller ~]# rm -rfv /etc/yum.repos.d/* [root@compute ~]# rm -rfv /etc/yum.repos.d/* Second, according to the question, we should create and edit a file named after http.repo. [root@controller ~]# vim /etc/yum.repos.d/http.repo write the information below into the file: [centos] name=centos baseurl=http://Resource/centos gpgcheck=0 enabled=1 [iaas-repo] name=centos baseurl=http://Resource/iaas gpgcheck=0 enabled=1 Then save it, and do the same operation in the compute node. But there’s a quick way to use scp to copy the file to it. [root@controller ~]# scp /etc/yum.repos.d/http.repo root@compute:/etc/yum.repos.d/http.repo Then type the password of the root in compute node, the file will be sent. And of course, I will use the quick way to do the same executions. [Question 3] Configure SSH without keys [0.5 points] Configure the controller node to access the compute node without a key, and then attempt an SSH connection to the hostname of the compute node for testing. After completion, submit the username, password, and IP address of the controller node in the answer box. It’s also an easy and necessary operation we have to do, because we can make the controller node easier to transfer files and execute commands in compute node. So the first thing we have to do is generate a ssh-key: [root@controller ~]# ssh-keygen Then press the Enter to confirm your requirements of generation according to the information in terminal. Normally you will see these: Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub The key fingerprint is: SHA256:FYN98pz53tfocj5Q4DO90jqqN+lJdzXi9WKMFNjm4Wc root@Resource The key's randomart image","date":"2023-05-04","objectID":"/posts/attempted_solution_to_the_openstack_provincial_competition_problem_part1/:3:1","tags":["OpenStack","Linux","CentOS","Competition","Installation","Notes","Attempt","operations and maintenance","Keystone","Glance","Placement","Nova","Neutron","Swift","Cinder","Manila"],"title":"Attempted solution to the OpenStack Provincial Competition problem (Part One: Installation)","uri":"/posts/attempted_solution_to_the_openstack_provincial_competition_problem_part1/"},{"categories":["operations and maintenance"],"content":"Conclusion Well, finally, I finished all the steps of establishing the OpenStack!

The first question I was asked was why the content of the title (\u003ch1\u003e tag) wasn’t showing up. I took a look at their code: \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eTest\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cp\u003e ppp \u003ch1\u003eTT\u003c/h1\u003e pppp \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e I couldn’t believe it – they put the \u003ch1\u003e tag inside the \u003cp\u003e tag… It’s clear that they aren’t familiar with either of these tags. Both \u003ch1\u003e and \u003cp\u003e are block-level elements, and by default the font size of \u003ch1\u003e is larger than that of \u003cp\u003e. Therefore, putting them together may result in display errors. Normally, these two tags exist on the same level, and both will occupy a line to display. If the larger \u003ch1\u003e tag is nested inside the smaller one, of course you won’t be able to see it~ In summary, there cannot be headings within paragraphs, and they cannot be nested within each other. Therefore, the correct way to write it should be as follows: \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eTest\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003ch1\u003eThe Title Of An article.\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Paragraph.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e ","date":"2022-11-17","objectID":"/posts/something-about-html-css/:1:1","tags":["HTML","CSS","Front-end","Web Design","Basics","Rant"],"title":"Some Thoughts on Writing HTML and CSS","uri":"/posts/something-about-html-css/"},{"categories":["Web"],"content":"Missing Symbols Sometimes I get asked about this issue as well, and I feel like these are all basic errors.

Or perhaps they don’t know how to represent tags. Let me explain again: there are two types of tags, single tags and double tags. Taking the tag for inserting an image as an example, the single tag looks like this: \u003cimg /\u003e. The \u003c at the beginning and \u003e at the end can’t be left out, and it’s best to add a / before the closing \u003e. As for double tags, let’s take the paragraph tag as an example: \u003cp\u003eThis is a paragraph.\u003c/p\u003e. This type of double tag must have an opening and closing tag. Neither the beginning nor the end can be left out. When writing double tags and there’s nesting involved, it’s a good habit to indent each level on a new line. \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eTest\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"Box1\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"Box2\"\u003e \u003ch1\u003eTitle\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cp\u003ePara1\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cp\u003ePara2\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e This way, the code is not only beautiful, but it’s also easier to maintain and troubleshoot in the future.

I can only explain it this way: The \u003chead\u003e section is the header information area, which is what the server sends to the browser. The code inside it is not rendered on the page in the browser. The \u003cbody\u003e section is the content display area, used to write tags that can be displayed.

My personal favorite is to use \u003clink\u003e to link the stylesheet. This way, you can split it into two files and write them side by side, making it very convenient. You don’t need to flip back and forth like with inline styles. As for inline styles? They’re not used much, I almost never use them in practice. But there are still people who don’t know how to link stylesheets? The main issue is not understanding the concept of paths. It’s actually very simple – just remember the relative path and then fill it into the href attribute value of the \u003clink\u003e tag. \u003clink type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/style.css\" /\u003e Of course, there are still people who don’t know how to use inline styles, but there’s not much to say about it. Just remember that the \u003cstyle\u003e tag must be placed inside the \u003chead\u003e section and then write the styles using the correct CSS format inside the \u003cstyle\u003e tag.

Setting its margin and padding properties to 0 before everything else can eliminate the default padding and margin for all elements before they are selected by a specific selector.

I often see something like this: .a1{ } .a2{ } #b1{ } #b2{ } It’s hard to know what element it actually selects, which increases workload… Because at first glance, it’s unclear what it refers to. Also, using Chinese characters for naming, although I used to like to do this when I was in middle school, this habit is not good because if there are some server encoding issues, the style files may not be loaded properly. h1.中央标题 { text-align:center; font-size:22px; } h1.一级标题 { font-size:22px; } h2.二级标题 { font-size:20px; } h2.三级标题 { font-size:18px; } h2.四级标题 { font-size:16px; } p.普通文字 { text-indent:25px; font-size:15px; text-align:justify; } But some people even use numbers! And then they ask me why the style is not displaying properly! .1{ color: red; } Numbers or names that start with numbers cannot be used as class selector names and IDs in CSS. Similarly, in many programming languages, it is not allowed to name variables using numbers or names that begin with numbers. To avoid this problem, naming conventions such as camelCase and _ concatenation can be used. Upper camel case refers to two words combined, with the first letter of each word capitalized, such as TopHead. Lower camel case refers to two words combined, with only the first letter of the second word capitalized, such as contentPlace. For naming conventions with more than two words, the _ character is needed to combine them, such as the_menu_bar. .TopHead{ width: 1000px; height: 300px; } .contentPlace{ width: 1000px; height: auto; } .the_menu_bar{ width: 100%; height: 50px; background-color: blue; } This significantly improves readability so that one can generally tell at a glance which element corresponds to which, without having to spend time searching through the code.

Therefore, this requires the use of command line options… just like some software we commonly use, such as pacman. So I googled it and learned about ArgParse. The argparse module makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces. The program defines what arguments it requires, and argparse will figure out how to parse those out of sys.argv. The argparse module also automatically generates help and usage messages and issues errors when users give the program invalid arguments. From: argparse â Parser for command-line options, arguments and sub-commands — Python 3.9.5 documentation Then I tried typing a file… The result of running it looks like this: So let’s organize some related notes… Creating Parser \u0026\u0026 Adding Options Before everything starts, we need to use the ArgumentParser usage in the argparse library to create a variable named parser. import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='') There is a parameter description='' here, which is used for writing some explanations… For example, we wrote: import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Welcome') By the way, we need to write down some necessary options~ parser.add_argument() can be used here. We need to add some things inside, such as the usage format of options like -a and --about. Finally, add args = parser.parse_args(). import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Welcome') parser.add_argument('-a','--about', help='Show the about') args = parser.parse_args() At this point, we can add -h to see the effect. $ python a.py -h usage: a.py [-h] [-a ABOUT] Welcome optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -a ABOUT, --about ABOUT Show the about Then let’s organize a few commonly used parameters. default * The default value when no parameters are set. parser.add_argument('-a','--about', help='Show the about', defualt='text.txt') If the user does not set this parameter, a default one will be provided automatically. help Add explanatory text to the corresponding option. required Used to determine whether this parameter must be set. If required=True is set, an error will be reported if this parameter is not set at runtime. parser.add_argument('-a','--about', required=True) $ python a.py usage: a.py [-h] -a ABOUT a.py: error: the following arguments are required: -a/--about Calling the Obtained Option Parameters Next, we need to use the obtained parameters. We know that when something is written after an option on the command line, the program will get it as a string by default. Then we have to use this to do what we want. I wrote a simple script that can write the contents of one file to another file. import argparse print(''' By WeepingDogel ''') def GetParser(): parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Help', epilog='A new testing program.') parser.add_argument('-o','--output', help='Output file',default='test.txt' , required=True) parser.add_argument('-r','--read',help='read a file', required=True) return parser def Write(content, filename): f = open(filename,\"a\") f.write(content) f.close() print(filename + ' has been written') def Read(filename): f = open(filename) text = f.read() return text def Main(): parser = GetParser() args = parser.parse_args() Write(Read(args.read),args.output) Main() It is easy to see that what we obtain will go into the variable args, because it is assigned from the content returned by the function parser.parse_args(). To get the corresponding value of an option parameter, you can access it using args.option_name. For example, if we want to get the written file name: $ vim b.py import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Help', epilog='A new testing program.') parser.add_argument('-o','--output', help='Output file',default='test.txt' , required=True) args = parser.parse_args() filename = args.output print(\"The filename is \"+ filenam","date":"2021-05-16","objectID":"/posts/python%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0-argparse/:0:0","tags":["Notes","Linux","Python","Programming"],"title":"Python Learning Notes - ArgParse","uri":"/posts/python%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0-argparse/"},{"categories":["problem solving"],"content":"Help her write an assignment qwq","date":"2020-12-02","objectID":"/posts/%E5%B8%AE%E5%81%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/","tags":["C language","homework","assignment help","example"],"title":"Help with College Computer Homework","uri":"/posts/%E5%B8%AE%E5%81%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/"},{"categories":["problem solving"],"content":"Introduction Help with homework qwq… I haven’t played with C language for a long time, let me try to see if I can do it.

This is straightforward. We need to list several grade levels: Excellent 80 ~ 100 points [80,100] Pass 60~79 points [60,79] Fail Below 60 points [0,60) In the code, we can use expressions to represent the intervals, for example: score \u003e= 80 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c= 100 Then we use if() to determine the grade level. #include\u003cstdio.h\u003e int main(){ int score = 85; if(score \u003e= 80 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c= 100){ printf(\"The grade is excellent\"); }else if(score \u003e= 60 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c= 79){ printf(\"The grade is pass\"); }else if(score \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c 60){ printf(\"The grade is fail\"); } } Next, we run the program. Output: weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e make test cc test.c -o test weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e ./test The grade is excellent⏎ Then we need to get the user’s input for the grade, like this, using the scanf() function to get the user’s input and assign it to an integer variable score. #include\u003cstdio.h\u003e int main(){ int score; printf(\"Enter your grade:\"); scanf(\"%d\",\u0026score); printf(\"%d\",score); } Next, we combine these two pieces of code together. The complete code is as follows: #include\u003cstdio.h\u003e int main(){ int score; printf(\"Enter your grade:\"); scanf(\"%d\",\u0026score); if(score \u003e= 80 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c= 100){ printf(\"The grade is excellent\"); }else if(score \u003e= 60 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c= 79){ printf(\"The grade is pass\"); }else if(score \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c 60){ printf(\"The grade is fail\"); } } The idea is to first use scanf() function to get the user’s input for the grade, then use if() statements to compare and output the result. This is the output: weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e make test cc test.c -o test weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e ./test Enter your grade:99 The grade is excellent⏎ weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e ./test Enter your grade:85 The grade is excellent⏎ weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e ./test Enter your grade:60 The grade is pass⏎ weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e ./test Enter your grade:59 The grade is fail⏎ ","date":"2020-12-02","objectID":"/posts/%E5%B8%AE%E5%81%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/:2:0","tags":["C language","homework","assignment help","example"],"title":"Help with College Computer Homework","uri":"/posts/%E5%B8%AE%E5%81%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%9A/"},{"categories":["problem solving"],"content":"Experiment 12 Experiment Purpose: Understand C program design ideas Understand C program design frameworks Task content Requires writing a program that registers and then logs in, outputting the format shown in the following figure: -------------------------------------- Registration Interface Please enter your registration username: Ly Please enter your registration password: 123 Congratulations!

Use if…else statement to complete the judgment of the username and password. To put it simply… it uses scanf() to get input, assigns the values to variables, and then performs the judgment… Pft! Alright, here’s the code, no explanation needed… #include\u003cstdio.h\u003e #include\u003cstring.h\u003e int main(){ /* Define 4 variables to save the registered username, password and login username, password respectively */ char username_sign[40]; char password_sign[16]; char username_login[40]; char password_login[16]; /* Define 4 variables to save the registered username, password and login username, password respectively */ printf(\"--------------------------------------\\n Registration Interface\\n\"); printf(\"Please enter your registration username:\"); scanf(\"%s\", username_sign); printf(\"Please enter your registration password:\"); scanf(\"%s\", password_sign); printf(\"Congratulations!

It requires using the strcmp() function, something like this. if(strcmp(username_login,username_sign) == 0 \u0026\u0026 strcmp(password_login,password_sign) == 0){ printf(\"Login successful!\"); }else{ printf(\"Login failed!\"); } It seems to calculate a numerical value, which equals 0 if the two strings are the same. That’s roughly how it works.

The content is as follows: “Oh, I see. Maybe you’re having trouble understanding how to do it. Here’s a detailed guide on how to perform the operation: First, move your mouse cursor to the bottom left corner of the screen and open the Terminal.” To modify the software sources, we first need to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file. It seems that Mint does not come with vim pre-installed, so we will use nano here. $ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list Note: sudo is required and do not forget to enter your password after pressing Enter in the terminal. When you open the file, you may notice that it appears empty except for some English comments. You can start writing into the file by following the instructions provided by the TUNA mirror site or other tutorial deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/linuxmint/ ulyana main upstream import backport I understand. To complete the process, we also need to add Ubuntu repositories as some packages in Mint require them. Let’s take a look at the Ubuntu help documentation for further instructions. Great, it sounds like you have a good understanding of the process! Yes, you can modify the URLs in the /etc/apt/sources.list file and replace archive.ubuntu.com with mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn. This will help speed up the process of downloading and updating packages in Linux Mint. #deb cdrom:[Linux Mint 20 _Ulyana_ - Release amd64 20200624]/ focal contrib main # This system was installed using small removable media # (e.g. netinst, live or single CD).

But would the hacker be satisfied with just that? The answer is no, because he wants to escalate his privileges and obtain root access, which would allow him to do whatever he wants. Due to the fact that the system and kernel of this server are too outdated, most of the code used to exploit vulnerabilities only works on kernel versions 3.x or above, or cannot be compiled at all. It looks like he needs to think of another way. During the day, he rides his motorcycle through the streets and alleys delivering food, and at night he roams the network as a hacker. By chance, he went to deliver food ordered by an employee of that company and, as he entered the office area, he accidentally saw a note stuck to a monitor. There were some numbers and letters written on it, perhaps something useful. While the employees were eating, he secretly took a picture of the note with his phone and left.

Code that is not updated is prone to vulnerabilities. Slow password updates can lead to leaks. Vulnerabilities must be fixed by updating software; otherwise, they will be exploited. And as for what we cannot see… Software is ultimately created by humans, and there is no perfection with humans. We must constantly reflect on ourselves and our creations. Whether as users or developers, updating what needs to be updated is a normal part of life. There may be differences in speed, but progress must be made. Standing still or even moving backwards is not an option. For software to be updated is like how humans need to self-reflect. If humans fail to self-reflect, their future will be bleak. If software is not updated, it will be abandoned by people and forgotten. Even worse, it could be easily destroyed by a script kiddie who delivers food, just like the joke I told earlier. The above is just my personal opinion. If there are any errors, please feel free to correct me in the comments below.

It is often jokingly referred to as Gayhub by some people. HaHa! Today, GitHub is: A community with 1.43 million developers. It includes top-level hackers like Linux creator Torvalds and young geeks like Rails founder DHH. The most popular open-source hosting service on this planet. It currently hosts 4.31 million Git projects. Not only are more and more well-known open-source projects migrating to GitHub, such as Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Ruby, Erlang/OTP, but also popular open-source libraries of the past three years tend to debut on GitHub, for example, Bootstrap, Node.js, CoffeeScript, and more. Ranked 414 globally according to Alexa. In other words, if you want to release your well-written open-source program, GitHub would be the best choice.

Creating a Repository Once you have logged into your account, you will see a green new button in the top-left corner. Click on it. Then, a form will pop up asking you to fill in some information. As shown in the image, the Repository name refers to the name of your repository. Note: GitHub only allows using a repository name that is the same as your username for hosting webpages. Here is a special format: yourGitHubUsername.github.io This repository name will become your website address. Once created, the repository will be empty.

Next, navigate into this directory: $ cd ./YourGitHubUsername Execute: $ git init This command initializes the directory as a Git repository. If you don’t understand it, you can learn more about Git here. Next, you can start creating and writing your website code. For example, let’s create a simple HTML file. First, create an index.html file: $ vim ./index.html Here, we use vim, which will automatically open an editing page in your terminal. Next, press the i key to enter the editing mode. Inside the file, enter the following code: \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eHelloWorld\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003ch1\u003eHelloWorld\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cp\u003eHelloWorld, this is my first website.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e You can use HTML language to freely write your website. You can add multiple HTML page files, CSS stylesheets, and even JavaScript to enhance your website. After finishing writing your code, press the ESC key to exit the editing mode and return to command mode. Next, press the : key, and you will see a colon appearing at the bottom left corner of your vim. :wq Next… execute $ git add index.html This will stage your created web page code file for commit. If you have multiple files, you can try $ git add * This way, you can quickly stage all your files for commit. Then, execute the following commands one by one to commit your changes: $ git commit -m \"first commit\" $ git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourGitHubUsername.github.io.git $ git push -u origin master Next, enter your GitHub username and password to complete the submission.

Still confused? Let’s take a look using a browser. Open any webpage. Using Chrome/Chromium as an example, right-click and select “Inspect”, then go to the “Network” tab, and check the “Preserve log” checkbox. Refresh the page and you’ll see the following content: As you can see, the browser displays the request content in great detail. And the left lists are the contents you retrieve from the website.

The official live ISO for BlackArch is 12GB, which took me a long time to download using IDM. The network installation package is the same size as Arch, but I haven’t tried it. What’s more alarming is that the minimum hard disk requirement for installing blackarch’s official mirrors is over 40GB, which makes it difficult for most people to meet this installation condition. Secondly, its desktop environment is too basic and its performance is particularly poor, especially for i3 and spectrwm, which are impossible to operate. Fluxbox is the coolest, but its habits are not suitable for most people. Openbox has nothing, and it’s even harder to operate. It also doesn’t support Chinese, which is very annoying. Also, the dependencies are too messy, making it difficult to switch to other desktop environments. For example, when I wanted to uninstall others and switch to xfce, I couldn’t uninstall them with “pacman -Rs”. I had to use “Rsc” to uninstall them, but as a result, I uninstalled “lxdm”, which prevented me from entering graphics mode. Later, when I installed “lxdm”, there was a major color bug.

Secondly, users must have a foundation in the Arch series; otherwise, it will be a pitfall. It is recommended to install Arch first and then import BlackArch’s software library to install the full set of tools. Finally, please do not compare BlackArch with Kali or Parrot. They are not comparable in terms of tools.
